# 1D3CSEM
A Spectral Element Method for 1D wave propagation with 3 Components (3C) in linear and nonlinear media with/without excess pore pressure development


It is the extended version of 1D SEM code provided by Elise Delavaud developped during
her PhD work (Delavaud, 2007).

Certain modifications have been made on this original version by Elif Oral during
her PhD work such as incident velocity insertion by file, borehole boundary condition and 
new soil constitutive models, etc.

Among the new soil constitutive models:
* Viscoelasticity after Liu and Archuleta, 2006
* Nonlinearity of MPII model (Iwan, 1967)
* Front saturation model of Iai et al. (1990)
have been implemented.

For more details, the user is invited to refer to the author's PhD thesis (Oral, 2016).
